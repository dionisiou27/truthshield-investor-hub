> **Comprehensive Q&A for investment due diligence**

## 🚀 Product & Market

### **Q: Is there actually demand for this? Why haven't others solved it?**
**A:** The EU has spent €250M on detection tools but lacks intervention solutions. The World Economic Forum ranks misinformation as the #1 global risk. Traditional fact-checking is too slow (2-3 days) - we solve this with <20 minute responses.

**Market validation:**
- EU DSA creates €2.2B+ mandatory compliance spending
- 4 out of 5 Europeans have encountered misinformation
- German elections already under coordinated AI attacks

### **Q: How big is the addressable market really?**
**A:** Conservative estimates:
- **TAM:** €100B+ (AI security, digital risk, democratic infrastructure)
- **SAM:** €3.8B (European media integrity tools)
- **SOM:** €300M (EU institutional adoption through public tenders)

This isn't a niche market - every platform, government, and major brand will need compliance solutions by 2026.

### **Q: What's your defensible moat against Big Tech?**
**A:** We don't compete with Big Tech - we help them comply. Our positioning:
- **Speed advantage:** 100x faster than internal processes
- **Regulatory expertise:** EU-compliant by design
- **Specialized focus:** Democracy protection vs. general moderation
- **Nimble deployment:** Months vs. years for platform integration

| Crisis Communication | €25K-100K/crisis | Government, PR agencies | Medium |
| Government Contracts | €100K-500K | EU institutions | Medium |
| Academic Partnerships | €25K-75K/study | Universities | Low |

- **2028:** €3M+ (break-even achieved)

Path to profitability through recurring revenue + EU grant funding reduces cash burn.

### **Q: How much are you raising and what's the use of funds?**
**A:** **€600K Pre-Seed breakdown:**
- **60% (€360K):** Technical team - CTO + 2-3 engineers
